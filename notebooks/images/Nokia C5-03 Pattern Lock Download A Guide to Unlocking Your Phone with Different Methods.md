## Method 1: Answer Google Security Questions
 
One of the easiest ways to unlock your Nokia C5-03 with pattern lock is to answer the Google security questions that you have set up during the Google account creation. This method works only if you have a Google account linked to your phone and you have an internet connection. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. After entering the wrong pattern several times, you will see a "Forgot pattern" option on the bottom of the screen. Tap on it.
2. Select "Answer questions" and enter your Google account credentials.
3. You will be asked to answer the security questions that you have chosen before. If you answer them correctly, you will be able to reset your pattern lock.
4. Create a new pattern and confirm it. You have successfully unlocked your Nokia C5-03 with pattern lock.

## Method 2: Use Your Gmail Account
 
Another way to unlock your Nokia C5-03 with pattern lock is to use your Gmail account. This method also requires you to have a Google account linked to your phone and an internet connection. Here are the steps to follow:

1. After entering the wrong pattern several times, you will see a "Forgot pattern" option on the bottom of the screen. Tap on it.
2. Select "Enter Google account details" and enter your Gmail username and password.
3. If you enter them correctly, you will be able to bypass the pattern lock and access your phone.
4. You can change your pattern lock from the settings menu if you want.

## Method 3: Perform a Hard Reset
 
If none of the above methods work for you, or if you don't have a Google account linked to your phone, you can try to perform a hard reset on your Nokia C5-03. A hard reset is a process that restores your phone to its factory settings and erases all your data and settings. This method will unlock your Nokia C5-03 with pattern lock, but it will also delete everything on your phone, so make sure you have a backup of your important files before proceeding. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Turn off your Nokia C5-03 by holding the power button for a few seconds.
2. Press and hold the power button and the volume up button together until you see the Nokia logo on the screen.
3. Release the buttons and select "Yes" to confirm the hard reset.
4. Wait for the process to complete and then set up your phone as a new device.
